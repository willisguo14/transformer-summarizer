But now four students at Riverhead High School on Long Island, New York, have been suspended for dropping to a knee and taking up a prayer pose to mimic Denver Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow. Jordan Fulcoly, Wayne Drexel, Tyler Carroll and Connor Carroll were all suspended for one day because the ‘Tebowing’ craze was blocking the hallway and presenting a safety hazard to students.
